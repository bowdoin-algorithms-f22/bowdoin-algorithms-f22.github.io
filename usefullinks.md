### Resources 


__Textbook:__ The class is based on the following textbook: Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein, Introduction to Algorithms, 3rd Edition, McGraw Hill, New York. The book is not required. It is available online, and there are copies in Searles 224. 

If you want to dive deeper into proofs and the mathematics of computer science, here are two good (free) resources: 

- [Building blocks for theoretical computer science](http://mfleck.cs.illinois.edu/building-blocks/) by Margaret Fleck
- [Mathematics for Computer science](http://opendatastructures.org/LLM.pdf)by Lehman, Leighton and Meyer

There are lots of resources online, such as lecture notes, animations, visualizations, practice problems, video, which you are encouraged to explore to further understand the material. However, you must be careful __not to search for specifi problems__ with the intent to get hints for their solutions.  Copying solutions from the internet violates academic honesty.  


Below is a list of resources  (by no means exhaustive) which I used to design this class and which I highly recommend. 
  
  * Visualizations with [visualgo](https://visualgo.net/en)
  * Mergesort [demo](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall06/cos226/demo/merge/) 
  * Sorting [vizualization](https://www.toptal.com/developers/sorting-algorithms)
  *  Most recently, [Stanford CS 161](http://www-leland.stanford.edu/class/cs161/index.html) 
  *  UIUC [Algorithms](http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/) by Jeff Erickson
  *  Tim Roughgarden's [algorithms](https://timroughgarden.org/videos.html)
  *  Berkeley [cs 170 algorithms](https://cs170.org/)
  *  Steven Skienna's [class](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/videos/) which includes lectures and video recordings
  *  Williams College [Algorithms](https://williams-cs.github.io/cs256-s21-www/index.html)
