The weekly schedule **office hours/study groups**  is below. The default location for the LA office hours is the computer science lab, Searles 224.  You should all have been given access to this rooom because you are enrolled in this class.  If your ID does not open the room, please contact the CS coordinator, Sue Theberge (theberge at bowdoin dot  edu). 

Remember that the LAs are  students first and they may occasionally  need  to change the location,  time, or hold office hours by zoom.  All changes and announcements will be posted on Slack, so you'll need to monitor Slack to be up to date.
