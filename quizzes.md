### Quizzes 

There will be a total of O(10) online quizzes, roughly one per week. The quizzes will be released in Canvas and there you will will also find the planned due dates.  The quizzes are a combination of multiple-choice and short-answer questions that test the knowledge from lectures and labs. Expect them to be short and focused on the specific topic discussed that week. Youâ€™ll take the quizzes remotely from your room. All quizzes are weighed equally (although the number of questions in each will be different).

**Rules**: 
- Quizzes are individual (no group work) and  at __collaboration-level 3__ (no collaboration allowed, professor clarifications only).  Make sure you read and understand the department's [collaboration policy](https://turing.bowdoin.edu/dept/collab.php). You may not talk to or consult with anyone about the prechecks and quizzes, and this includes former students who took this class before you. You may not post on any public forum any of the questions on the prechekcs/quizzes. You may not enter any quiz question into any websites.  

- The quizzes are __closed__ book and notes; you may __not__ consult any resource that may give you a hint on how to solve the problems.
