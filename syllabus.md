## Syllabus (csci 2200, Fall 2022)


__Instructor:__ Laura Toma, email: ltoma at bowdoin.edu, office: Searles 219 

__Class times:__ 
- Section __A__: MW 10:05-11:30, lab Thu 1:15-2:45
- Section __B__: TR 11:40-13:05, lab Thu 2:45 - 4:15 

__Classroom:__  classes in Searles 126, labs in VAC South 303 


Algorithms are the backbone of computer science. Everywhere computer sciences reaches, there is an algorithm.  This class is an introduction to critical thinking and problem solving through the design and analysis of algorithms.   Throughout the course we will consider fundamental computational problems and their algorithmic solutions. We'll illustrate the process of coming up with algorithms, analysing their theoretical complexity, and arguing that they  work correctly. Overall the class will show that the "...subject of algorithms represents a powerful lens through which to view the field of computer science in general" [Kleinberg & Tardos]

**Prerequisites:** csci 2101 (Data Structures)

Practically speaking, we'll spend the first week reviewing problems and concepts from Data Structures, such as linear search and binary search, big-oh,  best cases and worst cases. While diving deeper into analysis we'll encounter _logarithms_ and _exponents_. If you have not seen these in a long time, expect to spend more time the first weeks of classes as you review them.  

### Learning goals 

After taking this class you will be able to: 

  1. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental computational problems and the algorithms proposed to solve them
      1. Illustrate how these algorithms work
      2. Analyze their theoretical complexity 
      3. Use them as building blocks to design algorithms for new problems 
  2. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental algorithmic design techniques (recursion, divide-and-conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)
  3. Demonstrate the ability to design efficient algorithms for _new_ problems  from scratch 
      1. Come up with ideas
      2. Argue whether they are correct (correctness justification) or incorrect (come up with counter-examples)
      3. Analyze their theoretical complexity and compare them
      4. Consider the question: Can you improve the solution?
  



### Weekly flow: How will this class work?

The class meets three times a week (2 x class meetings plus the weekly lab). Each week we'll focus on a topic (or a couple of topics).  Roughly speaking, the class meetings are dedicated to going over the new content and the  lab is for working on a set of problems that reinforce and extend the topics seen that week. 

The lab problems are meant to be solved in class, during the lab. Myself and the LAs will be around to work with you, facilitate discussions and answer  questions. The labs are there to help you fix and reinforce concepts while you collaborate freely with your peers and talk to us (myself and the LAs). Labs are __not__ graded, however it is important that you strive to understand all problems as they are designed  extend the lectures.  It is your responsibility to complete the lab problems and get your questions answered.   

Overall, labs should be fun and you'll find that most of your learning occurs while you work on the lab with your peers! 


Here's the weekly flow:

  1. **Pre-view the lecture notes.**    Each week, _before coming to class_, your first task is to read  the lecture notes for that week. It is expected that you understand the big ideas and results ahead of that week's lectures.   
   
     * Time to budget: .5 hour
           
  2. **Attend classes and the lab.** Come to class,  get your questions answered and work with your peers.  
 
     * Time to budget: 4.5 hours. 
  
  3.  **Complete the weekly assignment**. Work alone or with your partner to complete the weekly assignment.  Drop in to one or more of the study groups/office hours to check on your ideas and get your questions answered. Make sure to read the assignment policies and turn it in via Gradescope. 
   
      * Time to budget: 3-4 hours.   
 
  4. **Take the weekly quiz.** Review  that week's material, including lecture notes, slides, the lab problems and their solutions.  When you are ready,  take the weekly quiz. This is a short, multiple-choice/shor answer quiz administered via Canvas, which you'll take remotely. 
    
     * Time to budget: 2-3 hours.  

  
### Grading Policy 

The work for the class, throughout the semester, consists of:  

- __Quizzes:__ There will be a total of O(10) online quizzes,   roughly one per week. The quizzes are administered at this time via Canvas  and are  a combination of multiple-choice and short answer questions. Expect them to be short and focused on the specific topic discussed that week.  You'll take the quizzes remotely form your room. 

- __Assignments:__ There are a total of O(10) assignments throughout the semester, approx. one per week. 
- 
- __Exams:__ There will be 3 in-class exams. One in week 6, one in week 10 and one at the end of teh semester (the final exam slot).  The exams are non-cumulative, to the extent that it's possible.


The final grade will be computed based on the  pre-checks, quizzes and  assignments as follows: 

* Assignments:    40%  (each assignment weighed equally)
* Quizzes:        30%  (all quizzes weighed equally, drop  lowest score)
* Exams:          30% (3 exams weighed equally)
* Class engagement: tie breaker.  Attending class, working with your group in the lab, asking questions, engaging in discussions, volunteering answers,  participating on Slack, attending office hours and striving to turn in good work --- overall engagement will be used as a tie breaker when your score is between two grades.  



### Time Commitment
Preparing for weekly material will demand a significant time commitment, and it is critical that you budget your time accordingly.  You should expect to commit 10 hours a week to meet the expectations of the course, and perhaps 12 to excel. A tentative breakdown of the weekly time is provided above---- please budget 10-12 hours a week for this class.

Some of you will put in more or less time than what I suggested above.  If you find that you struggle with discrete math (e.g. logarithms, exponents, etc) you will need to allocate more time to grasp those concepts --- hang in there, you just need more practice. If you finish faster, take a look at the optional problems or just send me an email and I will happily provide additional problems.



### What you can expect from me: 
My goal is to create a class that's similar to algorithms classes at peer institutions. For many of you, this is the first and last algorithm class you'll take; some of you will go on to software engineering careers; many of you will go at some point through technical interviews. For all of these reasons it is important to pack  many topics  in the syllabus and expose you to many new problems.  The goal of the class is not only to  familiarize with basic algorithms, but also to be able to solve new problems on your own. 

The  syllabus is packed and you will find the pace and the problems ocasionally challenging. I often choose problems from the top R1 universities (such as Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, etc). To support everyone's learning at their own pace  I have created detailed lecture notes and an ample set of supporting study questions, practice problems and quizzes, many with solutions.

Please don't hesitate to let me know if you have any significant circumstances that hinder your learning, and we will work together to make an alternate plan.   



### Key Tips
You will probably find this class to be difficult. What makes it hard is that the material is theoretical and spans many levels of abstraction. Adding to that, coming up with algorithms is both an art and a science: there is no systematic way to have an idea, and problems that seem very similar, may have very different solutions. It is important that you know this ahead of time and you start preparing mentally.

Here are some suggestions for doing well in class:

* Budget your time as suggested above and give yourself plenty of time to read the materials and work on the assignments each week. Plan on 10-12 hours a week, and make a schedule which you follow every week. 

* Be pro-active about things that are not clear; search for resources on the Internet

* Self-reflection: Try to formulate questions, and try to answer them yourself.

* Find a group of peers to work with. Explain your ideas, and listen to theirs. Try to argue why an idea is correct, or try to prove it wrong by finding an instance where it does not work.

* Come to office hours, join the study groups and talk to the TAs; Listen to your peers' questions and get your questions answered.
Solve all problems that are assigned, even those that are optional.

* Don't be harsh on yourself if you are not doing as well as you expected. It takes time to learn, and often we learn (more) from mistakes!
