### Labs (Fall'22)

The weekly lab consists of a problem set focused on the topics discussed that week. The  problems are meant to be solved in class, during the designated lab time, working with your group.  Myself and the LAs will be around to work with the groups, facilitate discussions and answer questions.

Labs are __not__ graded. however it is important that you strive to understand all problems as they are designed to extend the lectures. It is your responsibility to complete the lab problems and get your questions answered. Solutions will be occasionally (but not always)   provided to support everyone's learning. 

Overall, labs should be fun and youâ€™ll find that most of your learning occurs while you work in the lab with your peers!
