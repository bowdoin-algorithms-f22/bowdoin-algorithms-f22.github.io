## Initial announcements, logistics, resources



Hi everyone, Welcome to Algorithms! We'll be meeting 2 x week for class, plus the weekly lab. 

We'll use the following resources: 


* __Github:__ This Github site hosts all _public_ resources for this class, such as syllabus and  lecture notes. 

* __Canvas__: The class has also a _Canvas_ site that hosts the online quizzes (but also video recordings, solutions, and whatever other private resources we'll use throughout the semester).  You'll also be able to view your grades in Canvas. 

* __Gradescope__: We'll use Gradescope for the assignments (and possibly also for the exams). You'll submit the assignments on Gradescope, and receive feedback on them also on Gradescope. The assignment grades on Gradescope are linked with the Canvas site,  so your Gradescope grades will automatically pop up in Canvas.  If you are registered for the class, you will be added to the Gradescope class and receive an invitation to join. 

* __Slack__: Class communication will be entirely on Slack. If you are registered for the class, you will be added to the Slack channel and receive an invitation to join. You will need to monitor Slack for class updates, including possible cancellations and location changes (in case there are any). You can contact me and any of teh LAs by private messaging on Slack. 

* __Zoom link__: All classes will be in person. If at any point we'll need to meet on Zoom, here is the zoom link (I have disabled the waiting room, but you need to authenticate with your bowdoin account in order to join):
