## Initial announcements, logistics, resources



Hi everyone, Welcome to Algorithms! We'll be meeting 2 x week for class, plus the weekly lab. 

We'll use the following resources: 


* __Github:__ This Github site hosts all _public_ resources for this class, such as syllabus and  lecture notes. 

* __Canvas__: The class has also a _Canvas_ site that hosts the online quizzes (and video recordings, solutions, etc).  You'll also be able to view your grades in Canvas. 

* __Gradescope__: We'll use Gradescope for the assignments. You'll submit the assignments on Gradescope, and receive feedback on them also on Gradescope. The assignment grades on Gradescope are linked with the Canvas site,  so your Gradescope grades will automatically pop up in Canvas.  If you are registered for the class, you will be added to the Gradescope class and receive an invitation to join. 

* __Slack__: All class communication will be on entirely on Slack. If you are registered for the class, you will be added to the Slack channel and receive an invitation to join. 


* __Zoom link__: All classes will be in person. If at any point we'll need to meet on Zoom, here is the zoom link (I have disabled the waiting room, but you need to authenticate with your bowdoin account in order to join):

All further announcements and communication will be on Slack, and I expect everyone will monitor it to stay up to date!
